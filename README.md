## How to run the app
### Running the backend
Setup docker container with `docker-compose up --build`

After setup, you can run the container with `docker-compose up` going forward, no need to build again

This will spin up a container for the Django backend ONLY.

### Running the frontend
Move into the frontend folder with `cd frontend`

Install all the packages with `npm i`

Run in development mode with `npm run dev`
